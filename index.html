        <p>
            - After Tertiary, I had emotional scars. I also lacked the know-how to pursue the IT industry<br />
            - I started do course after course, aimlessly, until I started to focus on my side hustle in the Forex Industry and met The Inner Circle Trader<br/> 
            - The guy had many things o teach and he taught me that for me to see success in<br />
            this endeavour I had to ficus on one method or strategy, and trade only 1 pair, at certain time <br />
            - That skill poured out to many other things and I thought, am gonna quit the Retail Indusry and start<br />
            on improving my skills in the IT industry, PS I saw the growing need for it too<br />
            - I searched on google, and found a course on HTML, CSS and Javascript... I did it and finished it<br />
